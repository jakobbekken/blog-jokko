Here is a little list of different kinds of tools, technologies, and sanity savers I use and like. I will try my best to explain why I use them or if I just find them cool and fun.

## Environment

- **Operating system**: [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)

  Perfect for devs - customizable, open-source, and packed with everything I need. Most importantly, **personal preference** and I love **tiling window managers**. Unfortunatly, I need to dual boot Windows on my laptop for doing my exams at the university.

- **Distro**: [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)

  After a lot, _and I mean a lot_, of distro hopping, I have kept comming back to NixOS. It is reproducible, predictable, and I really feel like **I have control over my system**. My configuration is ready to steal from on [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/jakobbekken/nixos-config).

- **Window manager**: [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)

  A tiling window manager for X11. It is simple and modular by using an X daemon to execute commands like [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd). I still miss some of the options of [XMonad](https://xmonad.org/), so I will probably switch back soon.
