```rust
let me = Student {
    name: "Jakob Moen Bekken",
    born: 2004,
    country: Country::NORWAY,
    city: "Grimstad"  // Originally from Hamar
    university: Uni::UNIVERSITY_OF_AGDER,
    field: "M.Sc Artificial Intelligence",
  };
```

I spend most of my time building cool stuff, automating things that probably don't need automating, and confidently pretending I know what I'm doing! I'm the leader of the line association [BETA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/beta-engineering-technology-association) and a studentmentor in the [FYSE project](https://www.uia.no/om-uia/fakultet/teknologi-og-realfag/studentmentorordning/) at <abbr title="University of Agder">UiA</abbr> Grimstad!

I love finding excuses to learn new tech, organizing events, playing <abbr title="Magic: The Gathering">MTG</abbr>, watching curling, and getting way too into all kinds of weird stuff. Feel free to reach out if you're curious, have questions, or just want to hang out!
