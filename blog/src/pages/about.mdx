```rust
let me = Student {
    name: "Jakob Moen Bekken",
    born: 2004,
    country: Country::NORWAY,
    city: "Grimstad"  // Originally from Hamar
    university: Uni::UNIVERSITY_OF_AGDER,
    field: "M.Sc Artificial Intelligence",
  };
```

$$
\begin{align}
    \vec{v}&=[4,3]\\
    a&=\vec{v}
\end{align}
